# Example OOD App in Node.js

## Usage

Clone this app into your sandbox, and modify the shell command "ps aux" to be
whatever you want. To restart the app so you can see the changes, this will need
to be done:

    mkdir tmp
    touch tmp/restart.txt

This can also be done through the Open OnDemand developer interface.
